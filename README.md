# React_TowerDefense
This is my final Seneca College project implemented using React.js. This is a team of 4 project.
It's React based project with an embedded javascript OOP coded Tower-Defense style game. 
The application utilizes MondoDB database to store account information such as credits, score, and account progress. 
I was the team leader of the project. I was the one to split tasks between the team members and submit weekly progress to professor. 


To run the projet you need to instal node and express for the API and React for the Application. Both can start with 'npm start command'.
The App requires the API to be started because the user has to have a registered account and be logged into it. 
The reason for that is because each account has their own progress such as:
- top score that's stored and displayed in "leaderboard" available in main menu
- user's credits that the user can spend to unlock new defense units
- information about units that are locked or unlocked on the account
